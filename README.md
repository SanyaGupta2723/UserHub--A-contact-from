This web userhub functions as a sleek, dark-mode user directory application, retrieving its data from the JSONPlaceholder API to present a clean and professional interface. The core functionality revolves around displaying user information in a responsive card-based layout, where each card details a user's name, username, email, address, and phone number. Complementing this display, the hub includes a robust search feature that allows users to filter by name, email, or username, along with a "Sort by" option for organizing the list and a "Refresh Data" button to ensure the information is always current. Furthermore, the application is designed with "Error handling for network issues" in mind, ensuring a resilient user experience even when data fetching encounters problems.
